# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## NEXUS - AI-Powered Incident Response Platform

**Project Name:** NEXUS (Network Emergency eXpert Unified System)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Document Type:** Product Requirements Document  

---

## Executive Summary

NEXUS is an advanced agentic AI platform designed to revolutionize IT incident response by dramatically reducing Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) through intelligent automation, context-aware analysis, and human-supervised remediation workflows. The system addresses the critical challenge of sleep inertia and cognitive load on Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) during critical 2 AM incidents where every minute of downtime costs thousands of dollars.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Reduce MTTR** by 70-80% through intelligent automation
- **Eliminate hallucinations** through context curation and topology-aware correlation
- **Provide explainable AI** with transparent reasoning chains
- **Enable 24/7 response** without human cognitive limitations
- **Scale expertise** across teams regardless of component familiarity

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Sleep Inertia Impact**: SREs require 22 minutes on average to transition from sleep to productive cognitive state
2. **Data Overload**: IT environments generate gigabytes of telemetry data per hour, creating needle-in-haystack scenarios
3. **LLM Hallucinations**: Direct data dumping into language models creates fabricated causal links and imaginary narratives
4. **Manual Diagnosis**: Traditional incident response requires manual sifting through noisy data
5. **Knowledge Gaps**: SREs may not be deeply familiar with all system components during incidents
6. **Inconsistent Response**: Human variability in incident handling leads to unpredictable resolution times

### Business Impact
- Downtime costs: $1,000s per minute
- SRE burnout from 2 AM alerts
- Inconsistent incident resolution
- Knowledge silos and expertise gaps
- Prolonged customer impact during outages
